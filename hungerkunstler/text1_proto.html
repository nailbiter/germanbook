<!--12.5-->
<span id="1" data-endon="19.6">
	During these last decades the interest in professional fasting has markedly diminished. 
</span>
<!--19.6-->
<span id="2" data-endon="24.9">
	It used to pay very well to stage such great performances under one's own management,</span>
<!--24.9-->
but today that is quite impossible.
<!--27.6-->
We live in a different world now. 
<!--30.2-->
At one time the whole town took a lively interest in the hunger artist;
<!--34.5-->
from day to day of his fast the excitement mounted; 
<!--38.0-->
everybody wanted to see him
at least once a day;
<!--41.1-->
there were people who bought season tickets for the last
few days and sat from morning till night in front of his small barred cage;
<!--49.1-->
even in the nighttime there were visiting hours,
<!--52.5-->
when the whole effect was
heightened by torch flares;
<!--55.5-->
on fine days the cage was set out in the open air,
and then it was the children's special treat to see the hunger artist; 
<!--01:02.9-->
for
their elders he was often just a joke that happened to be in fashion,
<!--01:08.1-->
but the
children stood openmouthed,
<!--01:11.0-->
holding each other's hands for greater security,
<!--1:13.9-->
marveling at him as he sat there pallid in black tights,
with his ribs sticking
out so prominently,
<!--1:20.9-->
not even on a seat but down among straw on the ground,
<!--1:25.2-->
sometimes giving a courteous nod,
<!--1:27.8-->
answering questions with a constrained smile,
<!--1:31.0-->
or perhaps stretching an arm through the bars so that one might feel how thin
it was,
<!--1:35.9-->
and then again withdrawing deep into himself,
<!--01:39.9-->
paying no attention to
anyone or anything,
<!--01:42.7-->
not even to the all-important striking of the clock that
was the only piece of furniture in his cage,
<!--1:48.6-->
but merely staring into vacancy
with half-shut eyes,
<!--1:52.7-->
now and then taking a sip from a tiny glass of water to
moisten his lips.
<!--1:58.0-->
