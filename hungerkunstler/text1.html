	During these last decades the interest in professional fasting has markedly diminished. 
</span>
<span id="2" data-endon="24.9">
	It used to pay very well to stage such great performances under one's own management,
</span>
<span id="3" data-endon="27.6">
but today that is quite impossible.
</span>
<span id="4" data-endon="30.2">
We live in a different world now. 
</span>
<span id="5" data-endon="34.5">
At one time the whole town took a lively interest in the hunger artist;
</span>
<span id="6" data-endon="38.0">
from day to day of his fast the excitement mounted; 
</span>
<span id="7" data-endon="41.1">
everybody wanted to see him
at least once a day;
</span>
<span id="8" data-endon="49.1">
there were people who bought season tickets for the last
few days and sat from morning till night in front of his small barred cage;
</span>
<span id="9" data-endon="52.5">
even in the nighttime there were visiting hours,
</span>
<span id="10" data-endon="55.5">
when the whole effect was
heightened by torch flares;
</span>
<span id="11" data-endon="62.9">
on fine days the cage was set out in the open air,
and then it was the children's special treat to see the hunger artist; 
</span>
<span id="12" data-endon="68.1">
for
their elders he was often just a joke that happened to be in fashion,
</span>
<span id="13" data-endon="71.0">
but the
children stood openmouthed,
</span>
<span id="14" data-endon="73.9">
holding each other's hands for greater security,
</span>
<span id="15" data-endon="80.9">
marveling at him as he sat there pallid in black tights,
with his ribs sticking
out so prominently,
</span>
<span id="16" data-endon="85.2">
not even on a seat but down among straw on the ground,
</span>
<span id="17" data-endon="87.8">
sometimes giving a courteous nod,
</span>
<span id="18" data-endon="91.0">
answering questions with a constrained smile,
</span>
<span id="19" data-endon="95.9">
or perhaps stretching an arm through the bars so that one might feel how thin
it was,
</span>
<span id="20" data-endon="99.9">
and then again withdrawing deep into himself,
</span>
<span id="21" data-endon="102.7">
paying no attention to
anyone or anything,
</span>
<span id="22" data-endon="108.6">
not even to the all-important striking of the clock that
was the only piece of furniture in his cage,
</span>
<span id="23" data-endon="112.7">
but merely staring into vacancy
with half-shut eyes,
</span>
<span id="24" data-endon="118.0">
now and then taking a sip from a tiny glass of water to
moisten his lips.
