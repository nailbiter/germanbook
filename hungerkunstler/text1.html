<span id="1" data-endon="19.6">
	During these last decades the interest in professional fasting has markedly diminished. 
</span>
<span id="2" data-endon="24.9">
	It used to pay very well to stage such great performances under one's own management,
</span>
<span id="3" data-endon="27.6">
but today that is quite impossible.
</span>
<span id="4" data-endon="30.2">
We live in a different world now. 
</span>
<span id="5" data-endon="34.5">
At one time the whole town took a lively interest in the hunger artist;
</span>
<span id="6" data-endon="38.0">
from day to day of his fast the excitement mounted; 
</span>
<span id="7" data-endon="41.1">
everybody wanted to see him
at least once a day;
</span>
<span id="8" data-endon="49.1">
there were people who bought season tickets for the last
few days and sat from morning till night in front of his small barred cage;
</span>
<span id="9" data-endon="52.5">
even in the nighttime there were visiting hours,
</span>
<span id="10" data-endon="55.5">
when the whole effect was
heightened by torch flares;
</span>
<span id="11" data-endon="62.9">
on fine days the cage was set out in the open air,
and then it was the children's special treat to see the hunger artist; 
</span>
<span id="12" data-endon="68.1">
for
their elders he was often just a joke that happened to be in fashion,
</span>
<span id="13" data-endon="71.0">
but the
children stood openmouthed,
</span>
<span id="14" data-endon="73.9">
holding each other's hands for greater security,
</span>
<span id="15" data-endon="80.9">
marveling at him as he sat there pallid in black tights,
with his ribs sticking
out so prominently,
</span>
<span id="16" data-endon="85.2">
not even on a seat but down among straw on the ground,
</span>
<span id="17" data-endon="87.8">
sometimes giving a courteous nod,
</span>
<span id="18" data-endon="91.0">
answering questions with a constrained smile,
</span>
<span id="19" data-endon="95.9">
or perhaps stretching an arm through the bars so that one might feel how thin
it was,
</span>
<span id="20" data-endon="99.9">
and then again withdrawing deep into himself,
</span>
<span id="21" data-endon="102.7">
paying no attention to
anyone or anything,
</span>
<span id="22" data-endon="108.6">
not even to the all-important striking of the clock that
was the only piece of furniture in his cage,
</span>
<span id="23" data-endon="112.7">
but merely staring into vacancy
with half-shut eyes,
</span>
<span id="24" data-endon="118.0">
now and then taking a sip from a tiny glass of water to
moisten his lips.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="25" data-endon="121.2">Besides casual onlookers
</span>
<span id="26" data-endon="133.3">there were also relays of permanent watchers selected by the public,
usually butchers, strangely enough, and it was their task to
watch the hunger artist day and night, three of them at a time,
</span>
<span id="27" data-endon="137.5">in case he
should have some secret recourse to nourishment.
</span>
<span id="28" data-endon="140.1">This was nothing but a
formality,
</span>
<span id="29" data-endon="142.5">instituted to reassure the masses,
</span>
<span id="30" data-endon="151.3">for the initiates knew well
enough that during his fast the artist would never in any circumstances, not
even under forcible compulsion,
</span>
<span id="31" data-endon="153.8">swallow the smallest morsel of food;
</span>
<span id="32" data-endon="157.1">the honor
of his profession forbade it.
</span>
<span id="33" data-endon="161.4">Not every watcher, of course, was capable of
understanding this,
</span>
<span id="34" data-endon="166.8">there were often groups of night watchers who were very lax
in carrying out their duties
</span>
<span id="35" data-endon="172.2">and deliberately hudled together in a retired
corner to play cards with great absorption,
</span>
<span id="36" data-endon="176.5">obviously intending to give the
hunger artist the chance of a little refreshment,
</span>
<span id="37" data-endon="179.7">which they supposed he could
draw from some private hoard.
</span>
<span id="38" data-endon="183.4">Nothing annoyed the artist more than such
watchers;
</span>
<span id="39" data-endon="185.3">they made him miserable;
</span>
<span id="40" data-endon="188.0">they made his fast seem unendurable;
</span>
<span id="41" data-endon="192.9">sometimes he mastered his feebleness sufficiently to sing during their watch
</span>
<span id="42" data-endon="198.2">for as long as he could keep going, to show them how unjust their suspicions
were.
</span>
<span id="43" data-endon="200.3">But that was of little use;
</span>
<span id="44" data-endon="206.1">they only wondered at his cleverness in being
able to fill his mouth even while singing.
</span>
<span id="45" data-endon="211.4">Much more to his taste were the
watchers who sat up close to the bars,
</span>
<span id="46" data-endon="219.6">who were not content with the dim night
lighting of the hall
but focused him in the full glare of the electric pocket
torch
</span>
<span id="47" data-endon="221.3">given them by the impresario.
</span>
<span id="48" data-endon="224.5">The harsh light did not trouble him at all,
</span>
<span id="49" data-endon="227.1">in any case he could never sleep properly,
</span>
<span id="50" data-endon="229.2">and he could always drowse a little,
</span>
<span id="51" data-endon="234.6">even when the hall was thronged with noisy onlookers.
</span>
<span id="52" data-endon="240.6">He was quite happy at the
prospect of spending a sleepless night with such watchers;
</span>
<span id="53" data-endon="243.2">he was ready to
exchange jokes with them,
</span>
<span id="54" data-endon="245.9">to tell them stories out of his nomadic life,
</span>
<span id="55" data-endon="256.2">anything at all to keep them awake and demonstrate to them that he had no
eatables in his cage and that he was fasting as not one of them could fast.
</span>
<span id="56" data-endon="264.0">But
his happiest moment was when the morning came and an enormous breakfast was
brought them, at his expense,
</span>
<span id="57" data-endon="270.6">on which they flung themselves with the keen
appetite of healthy men after a weary night of wakefulness.
</span>
<span id="58" data-endon="277.5">Of course there
were people who argued that this breakfast was an unfair attempt to bribe the
watchers,
</span>
<span id="59" data-endon="279.0">but that was going rather too far,
</span>
<span id="60" data-endon="286.2">and when they were invited to take
on a night's vigil without a breakfast,
merely for the sake of the cause,
</span>
<span id="61" data-endon="288.3">they made themselves scarce,
</span>
<span id="62" data-endon="291.7">although they stuck stubbornly to their suspicions.
